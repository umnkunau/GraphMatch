GraphMatch (GM) is a scalable graph database solution based on Neo4j for storing and searching variable resolution genotype information supporting Patient/Donor matching for stem cell transplants. Performance timing remained linear with the number of edges, even at a production scale.  In general, GM demonstrates the utility of graph databases as a flexible platform for scalable patient/donor matching solutions.

# GraphMatch
GraphMatch (GM) is a scalable graph database solution for storing and searching variable resolution genotype information. Performance timing remained linear with the number of edges, even at a production scale.  In general, GM demonstrates the utility of graph databases as a flexible platform for scalable patient/donor matching solutions.
